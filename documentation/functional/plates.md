# Plates

Plates are required to give prepared ingredients to customers. Players get plates from the plate cupboard workstation. They are to be passed to the serving area in the same manor as [ingredients](ingredients.md).

If a plate is passed in a direction where there is no workstation, it drops to the floor and cannot be used.

Certain plates can be washed and reused after they have been served to a customer. Some plates are directly disposed of by customers.
