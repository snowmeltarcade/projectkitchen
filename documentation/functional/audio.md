## Music

Simple, catchy and mild music should categorize the tone needed. Non-game play scenes (menus etc...) should have simple, looping melodies that keep the attention of the player.

Game play scenes should have music that gives the players a warm and relaxing feeling. As game time gets low, the music should become more up-beat with an increasing tempo. The player should start to feel greater excitement and anxiety to finish the scene's minimum requirements.

Game play music should match the style of the kitchen they are playing in, whilst all having a common theme.

## Sound Effects

Short, simple and cute sound effects should be used. These should be consistent and clearly identify the associated function, such as selecting a menu option, chopping a vegetable or gaining points. Each sound effect should be distinct enough for the player to recognize a function by its sound, but all have a common theme so the player knows they all belong to the this game.
