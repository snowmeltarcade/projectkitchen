# Kitchens

There are 5 different styles of "kitchens":
 * Farmers market
 * Festival food, e.g. food truck, county fair
 * Fast food
 * Diner
 * Resturant

These types of "kitchens" differ in the types of stations that they would have. For multi-player, each person would be designated a different station; if there are indufficient players, then individual players will have to move from station to station.

## Farmers market

This is defined by having products that need to, at most, cut, and then packaged. A package/plate to be delivered to a customer could have several different types of ingredients, but they would be very simple to prepare. There would be 2 different stations:

 1. Prep (cutting)
 2. Serving (delivering to customers)

## Festival food

This is defined by having a few simple recipies that never vary, but which may require frying, boiling, grilling, or other steps, in addition to potenatially cutting. Thus, ingrediences may require 2 preperation steps, e.g. cutting potatoes and then frying them. It would be expected that as the kitchen becomes more complex it may have both a fry station and a grill station, and higher levels of difficulty would include boiling and more. Still, each ingredient will be capped at two preparation steps and the recipies will not vary, i.e. there is only one type of burger or grilled sandwich made by the restuant. This menu simplicity promotes allowing the player to become accustomed to how to make a recipie without worrying about variances.

In addition to the above stations, this includes:

 3. Hot work stations (frying, boiling, grilling, steaming, etc.)

## Fast food

This is defined by having menu items that allow for simple variances. Like [festival food](kitchens.md#festival-food), each item will only need up to 2 preparation steps. The difference here is that a recipie may have customer preference differences. A customer may or may not want pickles on their burger. This difference requires a chef to learn to better read an order. The complexity comes from the fact that the customer may or may not eat the food. If they don't eat the food, you won't get credit for making it, if they eat it, they will give a poor rating to the resturant for serving the wrong thing.

In addition to the above stations, this includes:

 4. Pantry (there aren't unlimited ingredients)

## Diner

This is defined by there being multiple plates that need to be served together. Like [fast food](kitchens.md#fast-food), there can be variance in the menu items, but a plate may require a burger with pickles and a side of fries or, for example a burger without pickles and a side of mashed potatoes.

In addition to the above stations, this includes:

 5. Dish station

## Resturant

This is defined by fine-grained control of the hot stations. Using the hot station will no longer work like a timed appliance, but it will require a continuous interaction from the player to keep the heat active for a certain amount of time. The time required will vary based on customer preference. Some like their meat cooked "rare" others like it cooked "well done".

There are no additional stations for this type of kitchen.
