# Kitchens

Kitchens differ in the types of orders customers will make. This will require using different types of workstations to prepare ingredients to satisfy those orders.

Players can select which workstations a kitchen will have from a provided selection. Each kitchen must have at least three types of [workstation](workstations.md): an ingredient store, a prep station and a serving area.
