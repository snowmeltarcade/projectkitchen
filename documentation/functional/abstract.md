# Abstract

A collaborative game where multiple players work as a team to [prepare dishes](game_play_examples.md) of food based on set [recipes](recipes.md).

All players are presented with a set of recipes to create together and a time limit within which to create these. Within this time limit, the players, working together, should create as many of these recipes as they can. The more recipes they successfully create, the more points they get. If the minimum specified number of recipes are not created, the game is lost.

Each player is responsible for one or more actions that are needed to [prepare](food_preparation.md) the [ingredients](ingredients.md). Each player also has access to one or more ingredients. One player has access to plates. Another player has access to the serving area. The players need to take these ingredients and pass them to the other players for preparation. Once the ingredients are prepared, they need to be added to a plate, which then needs to be served at the serving area.

In the game world, players are seated at a round table in a [kitchen](kitchens.md). To pass ingredients or items to other players, they can pass these to their left or their right. One challenge is for players to communicate with each other and direct the passing of these ingredients and items so they get what they need. The more players that take part, the more fun this challenge becomes.
