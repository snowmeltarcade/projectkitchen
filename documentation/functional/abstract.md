# Abstract

A collaborative game where multiple players work as a team to [prepare dishes](game_play_examples.md) of food based on set [recipes](recipes.md).

All players are presented with a set of recipes to create together and a time limit within which to create these. Within this time limit, the players, working together, should create as many of these recipes as they can. The more recipes they successfully create, the more star ratings they get from customers. If the average star rating the players receive is less than one, the level is lost.

Each player is responsible for one or more actions that are needed to [prepare](food_preparation.md) the [ingredients](ingredients.md). These ingredients come from a pantry. The players have access to plates and the serving area. Ingredients are passed from player to player for preparation. Once the ingredients are prepared, they are added to a plate, which is then served at the serving area.

In the game world, players are situated in a virtual [kitchen](kitchens.md). This kitchen has multiple workstations. Each workstation can perform a particular function, for instance, preparing ingredients, serving completed menu orders etc... Players can work at one workstation at a time, but are able to move between other workstations that do not have a player. Players can move ingredients from one workstation to another. One challenge is for players to communicate with each other and direct the passing of these ingredients. The more players that take part, the more fun this challenge becomes.
