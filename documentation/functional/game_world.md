## Navigation

The player will drag the world map to navigate it and will tap/click a level to play it.

## Level Statuses

When a player has played a level, the number of stars they were awarded for that level will be displayed at that level's location. The total number of stars possible will be displayed, with the stars they have been awarded highlighted. If the player has played a level but failed it (were not awarded any stars), the number of possible stars will still be displayed, but with no stars highlighted.

## Level Requirements

To get 5 stars on a level, the player must have purchased specific workstations and have them at at least the required levels. This is so they can produce the required ingredients that will be ordered by the customers at those restaurants.

If the player does not meet a level's requirements, they can still play a level, but will not be able to produce all orders at a 5 star level.
